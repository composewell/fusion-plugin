-- | A GHC annotation to inform the plugin to aggressively inline join points
-- that perform a case match on the constructors of the annotated type.
-- Inlining enables case-of-case transformations that would potentially
-- eliminate the constructors.
--
-- This annotation is to be used on types whose constructors are known to be
-- involved in case-of-case transformations enabling stream fusion via
-- elimination of those constructors.
--
-- It is advised to use unique types for intermediate stream state that is to
-- be annotated with 'Fuse'. If the annotated type is also used for some
-- other purpose this annotation may inline code that is not involved in stream
-- fusion and should otherwise not be inlined.
